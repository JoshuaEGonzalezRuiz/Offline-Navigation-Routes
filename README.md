# Navigation and Routes

Project in which it is demonstrated how the offline route and navigation services work in the HERE SDK for Flutter (Navigate Edition) in its version 4.x.x

Build instructions:
-------------------

1) Set your HERE SDK credentials to
    - `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
    - `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

2) Unzip the HERE SDK plugin to the plugins folder inside this project. Name the folder 'here_sdk' : `plugins/here_sdk`.
3) Run a `flutter pub get` in the 'pubsec.yaml' file in the project's root directory

4) Run a `pod install` in the `ios` directory

5) Start an emulator or simulator and execute `flutter run` from the app's directory - or run the app from within your IDE.
